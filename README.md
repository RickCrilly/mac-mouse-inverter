# mac-mouse-inverter
I'm sure there is only me in the world with this problem. When I use the touchpad on a mac I have to have "natural scroll" enabled. 
As soon as I connect a mouse the "natural scroll" becomes incompatible with my brain and I have to turn it off. I do this dance 
everytime I go to or from my desk. The code in this repo detects will detect if a mouse is connected and change toggle the "natural scroll"
setting as required. 

Requirements
  - Swift. Download it here https://www.swift.org/download/
  - A weird brain that inverts when you have your hand on a mouse
